# Using Koina with MSBooster

## Why use Koina?
[Koina](https://koina.proteomicsdb.org/) (described in [Picciani et al.,
_Proteomics_, 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37672792/)) 
is an online service that allows us to leverage a remote GPU server for predictions 
from multiple MS2 and RT models, thereby democratizing deep learning. The following 
models are currently supported by MSBooster:

| RT models            | 
|----------------------|
| Deeplc_hela_hf       |
| AlphaPept_rt_generic |
| Prosit_2019_irt      |
| Prosit_2020_irt_TMT  |

| MS2 models                    |
|-------------------------------|
| ms2pip_2021_HCD               |
| AlphaPept_ms2_generic         |
| Prosit_2019_intensity         |
| Prosit_2023_intensity_timsTOF |
| Prosit_2020_intensity_CID     |
| Prosit_2020_intensity_TMT     |
| Prosit_2020_intensity_HCD     |

## Using Koina
Using Koina is currently only supported in the command line interface. You can invoke
it with a command like this
```
java -Xmx14G -jar MSBooster-1.1.27.jar --paramsList msbooster_params.txt
```
An example parameter file for "--paramsList" can be found at
[msbooster_params.txt](msbooster_params.txt). Add the lines below to the
parameter file:
```
useKoina = true
rtModel = _____
spectraModel = _____
```
Substitute the blanks with one of the models listed in the tables above.
You can mix and match, or even use "DIA-NN" for one of them if you want
to call the DIA-NN prediction model specified by the "DiaNN" parameter
in paramsList.

If you want to use an edited.pin from Koina in FragPipe, please load your workflow
in FragPipe. Uncheck all boxes from MSBooster onwards. Run MSBooster via the command
line. Move the original .pin file somewhere else, and rename the edited.pin file
to the original name (ex. move "search.pin" to a different folder, and rename
"search_edited.pin" to "search.pin"). Then, in FragPipe, reload the workflow, but 
uncheck the MSFragger and MSBooster checkboxes.

## Figure ideas for manuscript
1. Workflow figure
   1. How we work with Koina
   2. Models we support
   3. Table 1: Types of supported peptides for each (at least on Koina)
   4. Supplementary (timing of analysis of each dataset)
   5. Should we host server on our computer with GPU? Or does UM have options to 
   host GPU server?
   6. Incorporation into FragPipe (plus screenshot)
2. Number of peptides and proteins identified in each dataset (refer to 
[the datasets section](#datasets-to-test-on))
   1. Table 2: datasets each is trained on. Upset plot to show intersection
   2. 10 iterations of Percolator for each
   3. Show performance for RT and MS2 models separately
   4. Then, pick the best combo and compare it to using same model for RT and MS2
3. Transfer learning for APD
   1. Visualization of RT plots and spectral similarity distributions
   2. TMT testing, numbers of peptides and proteins
   3. TMT serine support
   4. Screenshot of how to use in FragPipe
   5. Also phospho? Since DDA datasets have phospho data
      1. Can demonstrate prediction of modloss fragments
